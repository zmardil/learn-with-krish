[Finding the missing number in the sequence - NodeJS](find-the-missing-number-in-sequence)

> Write a NodeJS program to find a missing number of given sequence. sequence start number is random but it is guaranteed n+1 sequence. e.g.: if range is 10 numbers then array would contain 9 elements as one is missing
i.e. : `numberSeq = [21,25,29,28,22,24,27,26,30]` here missing one is `23`. trick is if start number or end number is missing how to figure that. make sure they captured that.
